# Installing `conda`

Follow the [instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) for your system.

Notes:

* You generally want to install `miniconda` rather than `anaconda`.
* If there are 32- and 64- bit options for your system, choose the 64-bit option.

```{note}
People using Apple's "Apple Silicon" a.k.a. `ARM` a.k.a. `M1` or later chips may need to pay attention here.
At the time of this writing, the `macOS` installer that you find via the above links is for the older (Intel, `x86`) platform.

See [here](https://conda-forge.org/blog/posts/2020-10-29-macos-arm64/) for a link to an `ARM` installer.
This is untested/unverified on my part.

## Say `yes` to everything.

You will be asked questions during the installation.
Accept the default answers.
