# Setting up channels

Once `conda` is installed, you can tell it where to look for software.
The ecosystem consists of different `channels` serving up different types of software.

Given that most students taking this course are PhD students in biology, they will want access to the [biconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) channel.
Follow that link for information about how to set up your channels.

```{warning}
Channel order matters!
Follow the `bioconda` instructions exactly.
```
