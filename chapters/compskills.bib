  abstract      = "Summary: BWA-MEM is a new alignment algorithm for aligning
                   sequence reads or long query sequences against a large
                   reference genome such as human. It automatically chooses
                   between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end
                   reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is
                   robust to sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range
                   of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For
                   mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better performance
                   than several state-of-art read aligners to date.
                   Availability and implementation: BWA-MEM is implemented as a
                   component of BWA, which is available at

              Large Sample Sizes",
  author   = "Kelleher, Jerome and Etheridge, Alison M and McVean, Gilean",
  abstract = "A central challenge in the analysis of genetic variation is to
              provide realistic genome simulation across millions of samples.
              Present day coalescent simulations do not scale well, or use
              approximations that fail to capture important long-range linkage
              properties. Analysing the results of simulations also presents a
              substantial challenge, as current methods to store genealogies
              consume a great deal of space, are slow to parse and do not take
              advantage of shared structure in correlated trees. We solve these
              problems by introducing sparse trees and coalescence records as
              the key units of genealogical analysis. Using these tools, exact
              simulation of the coalescent with recombination for
              chromosome-sized regions over hundreds of thousands of samples is
              possible, and substantially faster than present-day approximate
              methods. We can also analyse the results orders of magnitude more
              quickly than with existing methods.",

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the
              new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast
              and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash
              table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is
              accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from
              a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped
              alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for
              alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The
              speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to
              the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We
              implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read
              alignment package that is based on backward search with
              Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short
              sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the
              human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both
              base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and
              color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both
              simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x
              faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition,
              BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence
              Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream
              analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source
              SAMtools software package. AVAILABILITY:
