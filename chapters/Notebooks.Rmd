# "Lab notebooks" for computational research: Rstudio, Jupyter, JupyterLab {#notebooks}

For lab and field scientists, a laboratory notebook is the fundamental unit of research reporting.
If your lab is funded by the NIH, you are required to give you notebook to your PI when you leave.
Your PI must keep that notebook for several years.  Current guidelines require that records be
kept for two years after the grant has closed, but the notes may be needed by your lab for much longer.

A standard lab notebook is relatively straightforward to keep, although it does require some diligence.
What do you do for your computational work?  How do you go from folders of scripts and output files
to something showing an arrangement of your thoughts and results into some sort of "story"?

A partial answer to these questions is to use notebooks as a form of electronic lab notebook.
Essentially, a notebook is a means of mixing text, code, and graphics.  Isn't that a paper?
Yes, although papers usually omit the code.  Notebooks are primarily designed for the generation
of dynamic reports, meaning that each time the data changes, you can push some button or execute a 
command, and the code to process the data and make the figures does its thing and the report is updated.

In a highly idealized world, we would write our papers using notebooks.  By doing so, we would be
stating that all figures, tables, and numbers in the text are based on the latest data files and
processing code.  For many disciplines, generating manuscripts this way is not feasible.  Imagine
that Figure 6 if your paper requires 300 CPU hours on your institution's cluster and a few
terabytes of space to hold the intermediate results, which are then processed by a series of `R` and/or
Python scripts.  It is clearly not possible to hit the `knit` button in `R Studio` from your laptop
and get the latest results into your manuscript.

If you are interested in notebooks and reproducible science, then I highly recommend following Karl
Broman's [blog](https://kbroman.org) and to also follow him on Twitter.

## R Studio (R markdown more generally)

[R Studio](http://rstudio.com) is a graphical interface to `R`.  Within it, you may manage the installation of 
`R` packages, and interact with the traditional `R` shell with the graphics popping up in a window on the right
(Figure \ref{fig:rstudio_linux}).

```{r, echo=F, out.height="4in", out.width="4in", fig.align="center", fig.cap="\\label{fig:rstudio_linux}R Studio on the author's laptop running the Pop! OS 19.10 Linux distribution"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/rstudio_linux.png")
```

`R Studio` is also an editor for `R markdown`, or `Rmd` files. There is an excellent [tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
online for generated `R markdown`.  Behind the scenes, a set of amazing tools called [knitr]() and [pandoc]() take your `markdown`
code and turn it into a more standard output format.  You can even select Microsoft Word (Figure \ref{fig:newrmd}).

```{r, fig.align='center', out.height="4in", out.width="4in", echo=F, fig.cap="\\label{fig:newrmd}The dialog box for a new R Markdown document"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/newrmd.png")
```

`R Studio` also has `git` integration as long as you work on a "Project" (`File -> New Project`).  You'll want to look at the
`R Studio` documentation online for setting up the `git` integration.

Within an `Rmd` file, you may write `R` and `Python` code, with the latter requiring [reticulate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reticulate/index.html).  This entire book is generated this way (Appendix \ref{techdetails}).  Feel free to read the `Rmd` files behind it
to see how various things get done.

My opinion is that `Rmd` files are the best solution right now for notebooks:

* They are plain text, and thus `git`-friendly.
* Support both `R` and Python in the *same* document is a big win.
* The files may be generated in any editor (because they are plain text).

## Jupyter and Jupyter Lab

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks are the most obvious notebook solution for Python (although see my comments above).
`Jupyter` is much broader than just Python, however, and supports a range of languages.  For example, you may write a notebook
in `R` using [IRKernel](https://irkernel.github.io/). 

The notebooks are run through a web browser, which starts a local server.  In general, it is tedious to run a notebook remotely.
For example, you want to work on a notebook on the UCI cluster from your laptop.  Starting it there via X11 forwarding will be a
horrible experience.  For effective remote work, `ssh` tunneling is needed.  See [here](https://coderwall.com/p/ohk6cg/remote-access-to-ipython-notebooks-via-ssh) for the original link.  Briefly, on the remote server, start a notebook server on an open port:

```{sh, eval=F}
remote_user@remote_host$ ipython notebook --no-browser --port=8889
```

Then, from your laptop or wherever:

```{sh, eval=F}
local_user@local_host$ ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:localhost:8889 remote_user@remote_host
```

Thanks to Andy Kern (U. Oregon) for this tip.

[Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) represents the next generation interface for this technology.

I like `Jupyter` notebooks, even though I've said they are not the ideal solution.  They are easy to use,
generate nice output, and I just enjoy the experience (aside from having to run them via a browser).  However,
there is one big issue with them...

### git

These notebooks contain big chunks of binary data.  For us humans, it is unreadable gibberish.  For `git`, it makes
tracking changes over time hard.  Your repository will quickly balloon in size, too. There are [tools](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to help see the changes, but the repository size remains an issue.  Other solutions, such as exporting from notebook
to `markdown` and just committing the latter, are also not ideal.  These issues are why I personally prefer `Rmd` files,
although I still happily work in `Jupyter`--it just isn't work that generally ends up on GitHub.
