# git and GitHub (and GitLab, and BitBucket...) {#git}

Writing code is an iterative process full of false starts, corrections, and more corrections.
A common experience is to end up with end up with a directory with a list of files looking something
like this:

```
do_analysis.sh
do_analysis_2.sh
do_analysis_fixed.sh
do_analysis.py
plot.R
plot_bad.R
plot_fixed.R
```

This is a world of hurt.  You cannot trust the file names.  You probably cannot trust the modification
dates--are you *really* sure you didn't `rsync` them from another machine, possibly forgetting to 
preserve the time stamps in the process?  If you learn one habit from this class, it will be to start every
new project with:

```{sh, eval=F}
mkdir new_project_name
cd new_project_name
git init
```

[git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system for code.  Before describing it in more
detail, we should define code.  Code is *any plain text file* related to your research.  That includes 
source code for scripts and programs, `markdown` files, raw data from the field, \LaTeX\ files, etc..

Other types of files may also be okay, within reason.  Image files resulting from plots are fair game.
Modest-sized compressed files of data may also be okay--the down side here is that if the files 
change then you cannot see exactly *what* the change was.  You would be limited
to seeing *who* made the change and *when*.

`git` allows you to do the following:

* Retain a complete history of all edits to your files.  This is done via a *commit*, which is the act 
  of saving a change in the *repository* for your project.
* Revert changes that you made to a file.  For example, you just made a bunch of changes that turned out
  to be a bad idea.  You can ask `git` to simply revert the file to the last committed version.  Or,
  you discover that you just committed changes by mistake.  You can ask `git` to revert to an earlier
  commit.
* Make and commit changes to the same sets of files *separately* in different *branches* of your project.
  For example, you may have two different ideas for how to do a plot.  You could work on them in separate
  branches, eventually deleting the branch that didn't work, only retaining the changes in the branch
  that you want to keep.
* Share code associated with your publications via uploading it to a website like [GitHub](http://www.github.com).

`git` lets you do a whole lot more, too, but this list is enough for now.  And once you get your code online,
you have a whole new world of possibilities (see \ref{github} below).

Tools like `git` are essential for PhD students now.  Too much of your day to day work involving your data
involves writing bits of code to reformat or plot those data, and you need an organized way to manage that code.
Journals are also likely to require that you deposit the code for your analyses and your plots somewhere, and 
`GitHub` is one possible place.  [Data Dryad](https://datadryad.org/) and [figshare](http://www.figshare.com)
are possibilities, too, but there is good reason to be skeptical of their long-term availability.  If a journal
requires you to upload your code to `Data Dryad`, then my suggestion will be to make a *release* of your code
on `GitHub`, download that release for yourself, then upload it.

## Basic operations {#basicgitops}

There is a lot to `git`.  This section gives something close to the minimal set of operations you 
need to know about.  Fortunately, `git` is so widely used that there exists an abundance of excellent
tutorials online.  These two are particularly good, especially the second:

* [From the main git page](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
* [From Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud)

### Initialize a repository

When starting a new project, do the following:

```{sh, eval=F}
mkdir new_project_name
cd new_project_name
git init
```

The result is a new, empty repository.  It contains a single *branch*. A *branch* is a history
of changes to the project.  The branch name is `master`.  Branches are very important and are 
discussed below in \ref{gitbranches}.

### Clone an existing repository

If your repository exists elsewhere, you may make a copy of it locally.  This action is called *cloning*
a repository.

To clone a repo from another location on the same system:

```{sh, eval=F}
git clone /path/to/repo
```

To clone a repo from another machine via `ssh`:

```{sh, eval=F}
git clone user@machine:/path/to/repo
```

To clone from a repo hosted on `GitHub` whose author is `account` (this could be your own account):

```{sh, eval=F}
git clone https://github.com/account/reponame
```

If you have enabled two-factor authentication with `GitHub` and want to clone your own repo,
you must exchange `ssh` keys.  More on this below in \ref{github2factor}.

### Add a file

If you want to add a new file to a repo, or *stage* changes made to a file, then use
the following command:

```{sh, eval=F}
git add filename
```

To undo a `git add`:

```{sh, eval=F}
git reset filename
```

### Commit changes

To commit changes to a file: 

```{sh, eval=F}
git commit filename -m "commit message"
```

Now, the changes are recorded in the repository history. 
The commit message is entered into the *log*, which is a history of the commit 
messages.  These records are for *you* and so should be understandable down the 
road.  It is tempting to write terse messages just to get the task over with,
but you may regret that later.

To commit all changed files at once:

```{sh, eval=F}
git commit -am "commit message"
```

### The interaction between add and commit

You may commit a file without having added it.  You may commit all changed files
at once via the `commit -am` method.  To commit a set of changed files with one 
commit message, `add` those files and then say `git commit -m "commit message"`.
Imagine you've changed four files, but you want a different commit message for
three of them:

```{sh, eval=F}
git add file1 file2 file3
git commmit -n "first commit message"
git commit file4 -m "second commit message"
```

### Undoing changes to a file

You will often find yourself in the position where you have made changes to a file, only
to realize that they are a bad idea for one reason or another.  With `git`, you can do much better
than your editor's `undo` features.  To revert a single file back to its last committed version:

```{sh, eval=F}
git checkout filename
```

If you have already staged the file via `git add`, you need to undo the add before `checkout`.

If you have changed a whole bunch of files and want to undo it all, there is a nuclear option
to revert them all to their last committed versions:

```{sh, eval=F}
git stash
```

The `stash` command is *reversible*, which is kind of amazing.  We don't discuss it here, as 
the details get complicated, but you can find more info online.

### Pushing changes to an "upstream" repository

If your repository is a clone from elsewhere, you'll eventually want to send you committed changes
back to "home base":

```{sh, eval=F}
git push origin master
```

More generally:

```{sh, eval=F}
git push origin branchname
```

### Perusing the history

To see the history of the current branch:

```{sh, eval=F}
git log
```

The most recent log entries for this book currently look like this:

commit fd6cb5a001e341536ff2f99c6e4c0a12f423b2a7 (origin/master, master)
```

The history contains the following:

* A `hash` for each commit, such as `00b974cb7ed4f13802aef203babf768dd3fa588d`
  This is the unique identifier for the commit.  You may use these
  value to force a branch back to any stage in its history (see \ref{advancedgit}).
* The author of the commit.  This is important for collaboration.
* The date and time
* The commit message
* At the end of some of the commit hashes, text in parentheses refers to 
  branch names.  I don't want to go into this too much here, but we'll
  discuss the first couple entires.  The entry `(HEAD -> git)` refers
  to a commit made locally on a branch called `git`.  The next 
  entry, `(origin/git)` refers to a commit on the `git` branch that
  has been pushed back to the remote origin, which in this 
  case is `GitHub`.  Thus, this list shows that there are 
  commits that haven't been sent back to home base.

## Working with branches {#gitbranches}

Imagine that you have the following situation;

* You have a working pipeline that consists of a mix of Python and shell scripts.
  The shell scripts submit jobs to the cluster and execute the Python scripts.
  A set of R scripts exist that do some downstream post-processing and maybe
  make a plot or three.
* A reviewer makes some suggestions that may or may not need to be implemented.
  Checking into this requires modifications to most of the files in your pipeline.

What to do?  You could make all the edits and commits to your `master` branch, but this
is not ideal for a few reasons.  What if the reviewer's suggestion doesn't pan out?
If that's the case, then you need to manually reset your master branch to the last
commit corresponding to your submitted paper.  It may be tough to find that commit
in practice (but see \ref{gittags} for some strategies).

Another strategy would be to make a whole bunch of edits and then `git stash` them
if they don't work out.  This approach could work, but may not be ideal if many 
changes are needed. (When a lot of changes are required, it is handy to have
a lot of commits.  In case of problems, you can later find the commit causing
the problem.)

A robust solution is to simply start a new history for these commits.  It 
version control jargon, we will start a new *branch* of our code.  This branch
will contain the commit history from a parent branch (often `master`), but
new commits will not be added to `master`'s history, but rather to that of our branch.
We can commit at will to this new branch.  If the changes are good, we can *merge*
them back into `master`.  If not, we can simply delete the entire new branch and literally
nothing ever happened to master.

```{r, echo=F, fig.cap="\\label{fig:gitbranches} Branches with git. Starting with the `master` branch in the upper left, we create a new branch called `feature` (1).  While working on `feature`, we add files and commit the changes (2).  When finished with the work, we switch back to the `master` branch and merge `feature` into `master` (3). The end result is that the `master` branch is updated to contain the changes from `feature` (4)."}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/branches_tikz.png")
```

Figure \ref{fig:gitbranches} shows a schematic of working with branches. In general,
you probably don't want to work directly on your `master` branch most of the time
(see \ref{gitbestpractices}).  Branches have so many advantages that you should
develop the habit of using them whenever possible.  The fact that you are not
interfering with the `master` history of the project is invaluable.  Being able to
just delete a bad idea or something that just didn't work out is quite useful.

When you do need to delete a branch:

```{sh, eval=F}
# Go back to master
git checkout master
git branch -d branchname
```

Occasionally, `git` may complain about deleting a branch with changes that haven't been merged.
If so, and you know you really do want to delete, use `-D` in place of `-d` in the above commands.

### Creating branches

When working locally, creating a branch is a two-step process:

```{sh, eval=F}
# Create the branch:
git branch branchname
# Check the  branch out:
git checkout branchname
```

When you create a branch, the new branches history starts off from whatever branch you were just on.
For simplicity, we'll assume that that branch was `master`.  Thus, and new edits and commits are *on 
top* of `master`'s history.

Figure \@ref(fig:gitbranches) shows a one-liner, `git checkout -b branchname`.  This shorter command says,
"if `branchname` does not exist *locally*, create it and check it out". (If it already exists, the command
fails and tells you so.) It is easy to get into the habit of always using `checkout -b`, which will eventually
cause you to create a local branch with the same name as a remote branch.  At this point, your local copy is 
probably the same history as your remote, and you cannot push it to the remote location.

As long as you haven't made any changes to this local branch, you can execute the following command
to make your local branch the same as the remote:

```{sh, eval=F}
git reset --hard origin/branchname
```

**Be very careful with branch resets!!!**  This command forcibly overwrites the local history with
that of the remote.

If you have accidentally created the same branch name in two different places and have work in each
that you want to keep, your life is harder.  You may try to merge your local and remote branches
via `git pull origin branchname`. However, that may not work out, which brings us to the next section.

### merge conflicts

I have painted a picture of branches consisting entirely of rainbows and unicorns.  There is,
however, one situation where branches can get a bit ugly.  Considering the following case:

* You are working on two non-`master` branches of your project.
* You merged branch `A`.
* You want to merge branch `B`, which has edited a few of the same files that `A` did.

A lot of the time, this "just works"--`git` can be magical like that.  Other times,
the edited lines overlap the same lines of the file or lines that are close enough
to each other that the intent is ambiguous.  In this case, you have a dreaded "merge
conflict" on your hands.  The merge will be paused and you have to manually edit
the conflicted file, add it, and commit it, before the merge can complete.  Some good 
info on how to do this can be found [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts).

A tautological solution to merge conflicts is to not allow them to happen.  Just don't 
mess with the same files from multiple branches.  Sometimes you just can't avoid doing so,
especially if you are collaborating with someone on a repository.

## "Tagging" versions of your code {#gittags}

If we return to the motivating example of using branches, we realize that we haven't covered
something important.  You just submitted your paper, and the plots are based on a certain 
set of scripts, and there is a commit in the log.  It is a **very good idea** to assign
a version number to your code now!  It `git` jargon, this is a `tag`:

```{sh, eval=F}
git tag -a first_submission -m "Code used for 1st submission of paper, yay!"
```

Now, the commit hash associated with the last commit is tied to the label `first_submission`.
And yes, you can have "version numbers" that aren't numbers, which is pretty great.

You can do a lot with tags, and the [docs](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)
covers this feature nicely.

## The fugitive plugin for vim

The `git` commands shown above are what you would enter into a terminal.  It is okay to
have two terminal windows open in the same directory--one for your editor, and another
to run `git` commands. (Even better would be a terminal multiplexer such as `tmux`
or `screen`.)  However, it is possible to use `git` directly from within your editor.

This section describes one such editor integration, which is Tim Pope's 
[fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) plugin for `vim` and `neovim`.

The rest of this section will make no sense if you don't use these editors, so 
skip if you need to.

`fugitive` provides a series of `normal` mode commands to execute `git` operations.
It provides so many commands that you have to go read the README 
and watch the screencasts to learn about it.  What follows is a tiny bit of
what it can do.  For the following shell command:

```{sh, eval=F}
git add file
git commit -m "made some changes"
```

If `file` is your current buffer, you may use the following `normal` mode commands instead:

```
:Gwrite
:Gcommit
```

The first command does the `git add` part.  The second opens a new `vim` buffer where you may type in your commit
message.  A really nice feature here is that the entire `vim` completion list is available to you, so you can probably 
auto-complete many of the words in your commit message. Finally, you save your commit message via:

```
:wq
```

Now, you are back in your edit window.

## GitHub {#github}

[GitHub](http://www.github.com) is a web service providing an online location to host `git` repositories.  As of 
mid-2018, it is owned by Microsoft.  `GitHub` is the most popular service in this class.  Alternatives are
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/). The latter is owned by Atlassian,
and the former is a smaller startup venture. `GitLab` is notable as the host of the `GNOME` desktop for Linux, which moved there from `GitHub` after the Microsoft takeover.

In terms of concepts, we will consider these three services as interchangeable.  We will only discuss the specific 
details of the `GitHub` interface, however.

These services allow:

* Code sharing.  You can put your `git` repos online using them.
* Collaboration.  Groups can push changes to these online repos, discuss them, and merge or reject proposed changes.
* Community organization.  Groups of user accounts can be members of Organization accounts.  This is a good thing
  for individual labs to do.
* Host web pages associated with projects.  You can even blog!
* A means of getting help and reporting problems with software by submitting "issues" to projects.

You may create repositories at these sites.  Once you do, you will get instructions for what to do
if you already have a repo locally that you want to push to this new "remote" location.

Your repos may be `private` or `public`.  The number of `private` repos depends on the service and the type of 
account.  I consider `private` repos to be of little use for code and moderately useful for papers prior
to uploading the preprint and for grants.

### Setting up accounts

This step is quite straightforward--simply go to the website and follow the instructions.

#### Two factor authentication {#github2factor}

I strongly recommend setting up two-factor authentication for your account.  There are many ways to do this for GitHub.
I personally use a [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/), which I also use for my UCI two-factor as it is superior to
what UCI recommends, although UCI makes it a bit tricky to set them up.  (Yes, they cost about fifty bucks,
but you are already paying monthly for your phone's data plan to use the UCI solution.)

Once you set up two-factor, `GitHub` requires you to do `ssh` key exchange for each local machine that you want to use to push
commits from.  This is a bit tedious, but is a one time setup.  I recommend against password-free keys.

### Issue tracking {#githubissues}

One of the best `GitHub` features is issue tracking. By default, active repositories have an `Issues` button
allowing you to submit a new issue.  Issues are often bug reports and/or feature requests or questions about someone
else's project.  They are also a great way for you to generate reminders for yourself when a project is in progress.
For example, you could submit an issue with the text, "Need to confirm the calculation of X".

When an issue is submitted, it gets a number.  Let's assume that our hypothetical issue is assigned number `1`.
When you commit a change, you may refer to an issue:

```{sh, eval=F}
git commit analysis.R -m "Added code to verify calculation of X.  Closes #1."
```

The `Closes #1` bit is some magic.  First, when this commit is pushed back to `GitHub`, the issue's page will show a link
to the commit.  Second, if the commit is merged into the `master` branch, then issue number one will automatically *close*,
meaning that it is resolved.  There are other words you can use to do the same thing, and it is also possible to refer
to issues in *other* repositories.  You can discover these features online.

### Pull requests {#githubprs}

A *pull request*, or `PR`, is a special way to treat a branch on `GitHub`.  A `PR` represents a request
to merge changes from a branch into `master`.  The `PR` may be accepted and merged or rejected and closed.
Like issues, they are assigned a number and you may refer to that number in commit messages.  `PR`s
are an important tool for collaboration, and I suggest you
[read about them](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

There is a lot of nuance to effectively using this `GitHub` feature.  One thing to be aware of is 
that you may want to couple them with issues.  For example, you may have a branch called `fix_issue_7`.
You commit a lot of changes to fix this issue.  If you merge it via a `PR`, you may want to edit the 
commit message to be `Closes #7`, and then the issue will auto-close.

## Common misconceptions about GitHub

I hear several concerns from academics about using `GitHub`.  I believe most of these to be non-issues,
and I address them here.

### GitHub could go away one day

`GitHub` is a corporate interest.  As such, it may close one day.  Prior to being purchased by Microsoft,
this was a valid concern.  After the purchase, I think there is little cause to worry.  Even if it does go
away one day, it will not be the end of the world for two reasons.  First, you will probably just migrate
to another service.  Two, you already have local copies of your repos, right? (See \ref{gitbestpractices}).

### Someone may steal my ideas

This section heading is the most extreme variant of a reason *not* to share code. Another includes
not wanting to put things out there that aren't ready.  These concerns hold no water.  If your lab
"does" computational work for its bread-and-butter research, then it should have an "organization"
account through one of these services.  If you or your lab insists on `private` repositories, then you
may have to pay for them once you reach a certain number. (`GitHub` has a generous policy here for
educators and researchers.)

If you are concerned about releasing code "before it is ready", then there is a misunderstanding
at play.  Code generated by publicly funded research *should* be open source and open source code
benefits from a "release early, release often" approach.  The single best way to find bugs and
limitations in your code is to have someone else try to use it.  The reality is that it will be 
hard for other to discover your code--unless you publicize it broadly, it is just one of millions of 
GitHub repos on there.  But it may be very useful for your lab mates to try it if they are working
on projects where it may help. You may help out on other papers from the lab and you may discover
some bugs.  Both are good outcomes.

Finally, there is the "someone may steal my ideas" meme.  This assumes that someone cares enough, 
and is malevolent enough, to do so.  In most cases, this concern is dealt with via some
tough love: **no one cares enough about what you are doing to stalk your GitHub commits**.
Think about it for a second.  A repo for a project in progress is likely undocumented and the commits
are highly technical in nature and the entire work flow likely depends on inputs that are not on `GitHub`
anyways because they are too big.  You would need to be working in an extremely competitive area full
of bad actors for this to be a likely outcome of using `GitHub`.  Yes, it probably has happened, but I 
really doubt that it is common.

The solution to all of these concerns, to the extent that they are relevant, is simple: push to a `private`
repo and then make it `public` *immediately* upon submission to a journal (or upload to a preprint server).
The journals that I edit and review for may treat the lack of an available repo as grounds for *editorial
rejection without review*, and I expect this standard to spread to other journals.

### I don't want to be responsible for maintaining this code

This concern reflects a fundamental misunderstanding.  Making the code behind your research public
is *not* the same as writing a general software package for doing the analyses.  The point
of sharing code is to document the work flow.  In other words, it is fulfilling the ethical duty 
to demonstrate that the research is reproducible, at least in the sense that the scripts used are
available.  If you want to indicate that you have no intention of updating the code, archive the 
repository (see \ref{gitbestpractices}).

## Git and GitHub "best practices" {#gitbestpractices}

### Try not to work on your master branch

Treat your `master` branch as a special place.  Ideally, it represents code that is known 
to work.  Use branches for making changes.

### Use issue tracking

I consider liberal use of issue tracking (\@ref(githubissues)) as a best practice for tracking the
progress of a project.  It is very nice to be able to have the issue on a website, possibly 
with a bunch of comments about it, and then to *know exactly* the commit or set of commits
that address the issue.  Yes, you could use note-taking programs to manage `TODO` lists
for your projects, but they won't have this deeper relationship with your code.

My lab writes most of its papers using \LaTeX, and we use `GitHub` during the process.  We use
issue tracking here, too, to discuss the evolving manuscript, etc..

### Document your repo

Make sure that your repo has a `README.md` file (`README.rst` is fine, too, for Python projects.)

The contents of this file are up to you.  If you do not intend to maintain the code further, 
then say so here.  Otherwise, you may want to point out any required dependencies, etc., 
needed to use the code.

If the code is a "one off" for a specific project and was only tested on a specific type of system,
then it is a good idea to say so.  Such details often matter.

### Add a license to your repo

It is very important that your code contains terms for reuse, which typically take the form 
of a license.  An open source license should be preferred for code resulting from publicly
funded research.  The specific license that you choose needs to result from a conversation between
yourself, your advisors, and your institution.  I cannot give specific advice here.

The license for a repository should be in a file called `LICENSE` and/or `COPYING`.

If you are worried about people "stealing" ideas from your repo, you should be aware that there is 
really no such thing, legally, if your code is out there in an unlicensed form, at least in the US.

### Document your code if appropriate

If you intend for other to use your code, it is helpful to document it.  Use the idiomatic
methods for your language(s) of choice to do so.

### Keep backups of your repos

It is not a bad idea to have local copies of your online repos.  For many years, I never pushed
straight to `GitHub`.  Rather, I cloned from, and pushed to, a local repository.  That local 
repository is what got pushed to `GitHub`.  I am less rigid about this now, but I still like the 
idea in principle.

### Learn to clone between machines

This is a corollary of the above.  If you are writing code on your laptop, but intend to run it on your cluster,
then the following may make sense:

1. Create the repo on the cluster.
2. Set `GitHub` as the remote origin of the cluster repo.
3. Clone from the cluster to your laptop.
4. Work on your laptop, pushing from laptop to cluster and cluster to `GitHub`.

Now, you have three copies of your work!

### Do not `rsync` repos around

`rsync` seems like a good way to copy repos from place to place.  But it actually doesn't work that well.
You will probably find that you cannot make updates to the `rsync`d repo.
The private files in a repo have very specific permission requirements, and you need to use 
esoteric `rsync` flags to preserve them.

I have not tested these flags in a while, but this is from an old script that I used
to backup `git` repos using `rsync` that was confirmed to work:

```{sh, eval=F}
rsync -avrRp --update --delete --progress --chmod=Fa-w
```

The correct approach is to clone the repo and then pull all remote branches with

```{sh, eval=F}
git pull --all
```

### Archive old projects

Code has a life span.  For example, the `R` scripts used to make plots for a paper may not
work in a year.  Tools like `dplyr` and `ggplot` change and a function that you used may no
longer exist or how you use it has changed.   More generally, a lot of research code exists
for a single purpose.  When that purpose has been realized, it may be time to "end of life"
the code.  `GitHub` (and the other services, too) allow you to *archive* a repository.
Once archived, a repo is marked as "read only" and issues, pull requests, etc., are no longer 
allowed.  In other words, the repo is only there as an archival document.  This is a great
end for scripts related to single papers, as it signals you don't intend to make sure that
it continues working into the future, but it still meets your obligation of making it available
for reproducibility purposes.
