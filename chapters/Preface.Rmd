# Preface

This book is my attempt to provide a "textbook" for a graduate-level class on "bioinformatics" skills for PhD
students that I team teach with Tony Long at UCI.  The course is the second in a series.  JJ Emerson teaches
the first quarter, which is loosely arranged around Vince Buffalo's book [@Buffalo2015-tj].

The contents of the book will be terse, idiosyncratic, and opinionated.  The goal is to provide readings for 
the first half of the class, which can be broadly defined as "skills for reproducible computational research".
