# Ergonomics

Make sure you have a proper chair.  Get your monitor set up to the right height.  You probably really like the freedom of a laptop,
but don't forget that it is really bad for you in the long run!  The monitor is making you crane your neck, and the keyboard has you
twisting your wrists at a funny angle.  The taller you are, and the broader your shoulders, the worse all of this is.
All of these issues will catch up to you, eventually. 

## Keyboard

The keyboard is your primary input mechanism for writing and coding.
As such, it is a primary ergonomics consideration.  A good keyboard should:

* Prevent twisting at the wrists
* Have all meta buttons (`Alt`, `Cntrl`, etc.) available on both sides
* Have good key "travel" meaning that your fingers don't bottom out while typing

Laptop keyboards usually don't meet all of these criteria.  For example, Apple keyboards only have `Cntrl` buttons on the left.
All commercially-available keyboards also have a staggered key layout, meaning that the keys "fan out" to the left or right from the center.
There is no real reason for this design.  I am a fan of the alternative "ortholinear" design where the keys are in straight columns. However,
all ortholinear keyboards are boutique products, and most are sold as DIY kits requiring assembly and programming,
which leads me to one of the few product recommendations in this book.  For my desktop computer, I use the [Ergodox EZ](http://www.ergodox-ez.com)
keyboard and I use a [Planck EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck) whenever possible with my laptop.  These ortholinear keyboards are shown in Figure 
\@ref(fig:keyboards).  I recognize that the price is steep, but I highly recommend these keyboards, especially the `Ergodox`.  Both take some
getting used to, but they have made a huge difference in managing my issues with carpal tunnel syndrome.  Both keyboards are completely
programmable, and you can control the mouse cursor with them, too.

```

For desktop computers, I like the offerings from [Das Keyboard](https://www.daskeyboard.com/) for traditional keyboard layouts.  The `Das`
is a nice mechanical keyboard which feels good and is not too loud.

If you do get a mechanical keyboard like the `Das`, `Ergodox` or `Planck`, please be considerate of your lab mates!  Try to avoid loud key
switches.  For the record, I use Cherry Brown in my `Ergodox` and Kailh Gold in my `Planck`.  Both feel great and are pretty quiet, but
not totally silent.

No matter what keyboard you use, there is one ergonomic improvement that everyone can make, which is to remap the `Caps Lock` key to something
useful.  That key is completely useless for pretty much anyone.  If you use the `vim/neovim` editors, then remap it to `Esc` if you haven't
done so already.  Your wrists will thank you.
